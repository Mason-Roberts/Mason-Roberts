## ðŸ‘‹ Hello
My name is Mason Roberts.  I am from a small town in Ohio, where I found my passion for programming and all-things computer science while researching for a high school class. During my senior year of high school, I decided to go to college to study computer science and applied for The University of Akron. While working towards my degree, I focused on using Python, C, C++, C#, and their corresponding frameworks/libraries. I graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science in May of 2021. I am currently looking for work in the industry.

During my free time, I enjoy learning new techniques, languages, and tools for my field. Besides learning new things in my major, I also love to do outside activities such as hiking or swimming and play games with my friends. If you wish to get in contact with me you can do so either through my GitHub profile or the contacts listed below.

## :dart: Current Focus

### Frontend Development
- CSS
- HTML
- Javascript
- Various other tools, frameworks, and libraries

### Game Development
I've always had a love for games and their development. I am currently learning some of the tools I would need to use to develop some small indie games to produce
some ideas I've had over the past couple of years.


## :package: Projects
My new projects will be available on this profile, but during my college coursework I used a [different GitHub account](https://github.com/UnknwonWarlock).

### [Mimic](https://github.com/link00000000/mimic)
A group project where [Logan Crandall](https://github.com/link00000000) and I worked to develop a remote IP camera over WebRTC.

### [Cmpct](https://github.com/link00000000/cmpct)
A group project where [Logan Crandall](https://github.com/link00000000) and I worked to develop a URL shortener that can also collect analytic data from anyone who clicks the links.

### [Illusory Wall](https://github.com/link00000000/illusory-wall)
A group project where [Logan Crandall](https://github.com/link00000000) and I worked to develop a a wiki for the dark souls games that instead of users seeking the information, the information could come to them. The users could use searches on the main page to bring the various enemies' data to them and compare their resulting stats with graphs.

###  [PCR Simulation](https://github.com/UnknwonWarlock/BIO-1)
A poject I did for Bioinformatics where we simulated PCR with the COVID-19 genome.

### [Gene Sequence Alignment](https://github.com/UnknwonWarlock/BIO-2)
A project for Bioinformatics where [Logan Crandall](https://github.com/link00000000) and I implemented pairwise gene sequence alignment with SARS and MERS to the current COVID-19 sequence. We then compared the results to say whether either SARS or MERS are common ancestors.

### [Minute to Midnight](https://github.com/PatrickHoward/minute-to-midnight)
A small game developed by [Logan Crandall](https://github.com/link00000000), [Patrick Howard](https://github.com/PatrickHoward), and I during an ACM game jam. The theme was to only have 60 seconds to complete the game.
