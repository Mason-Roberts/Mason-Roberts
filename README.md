## ðŸ‘‹ Genuine Tidbits
Personally I am not one to enjoy talking about myself, but my name is Mason Roberts. I grew up in a small town in Ohio that had little resources for anyone to want
make a living from working with computers. I found a love for all things Computer Science when I was in highschool and had nothing better to do, besides figuring
out what I wanted to do in college. I went through several ideas like architecture and botany, but the further I researched into them, I thought they would be better
as hobbies/interests. Soon after that I found Computer Science and almost immediately fell in love with it. For me, it combined the right amount of creativity, logic,
and critical thinking without being overbearing. After highschool, I chose to enroll into the University of Akron to study Computer Science and I am set to graduate
with a bachelors in May of 2021.

When it comes to programming, I enjoy developing games and various small tools, typically for my personal use. Although I have used various languages for projects, my
favorites are C#, C++, and Python. Outside of programming, I enjoy playing games, drawing, reading, swimming, and hiking when I find the time and oppurtunity. Since I
come from a smaller town, I enjoy a lot of outdoor activities even though they are harder to do in a bigger city. I consider myself an omnivert, so it takes time for me
to warm up to people, but I do enjoy getting to know others.
